	<p>Pholourie is a fried, spicy split pea snack.  It should be slightly crispy on the outside and light and tender on the inside.  Pre-mixed packets are available to buy and many are quite good.  They're also really easy to make from scratch.</p>
	
	<!--Picture Needs to be added here.-->
	<img src="images/pholoourie.jpg" alt="Picture of pholourie" />
	
	<h4>Ingredients</h4>
		<p>2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
		<p>� Cup Split pea powder</p>
		<p>2 teaspoons yeast</p>
		<p>3-4 garlic cloves</p>
		<p>2 green onion white part chopped</p>
		<p>� wiri wiri pepper minced or hot sauce  <i>(You can use any other pepper or pepper sauce)</i></p>
		<p>� teaspoon cumin spice</p>
		<p>� teaspoon turmeric</p>
		<p>1 teaspoon or more salt adjust to taste</p>
		<p>2 Teaspoons sugar optional</p>
		<p>1 1/3 cup warm water or more adjust to form a thick batter</p>
	
	
	<h4>Directions</h4>
		<p>In a mini food processor blend together cilantro, parsley, garlic, onions and scotch bonnet pepper until puree. If you do not have a processor finely chop the ingredients and smash using a motor and pestle or rolling pin. If you have green seasoning use about 2 Tablespoons instead.</p>
		<p>In a large bowl combine all ingredients except the water ; flour split pea and all-purpose, yeast, salt sugar cumin, turmeric, curry, onion mix and yeast. Thoroughly mix.</p>
		<p>Then add warm water a little at a time until you get to desired consistency � like thick pancake batter. I usually use about 1 1/3 cup . Thoroughly mix preferable with your hands.</p>
		<p>Set the mixture in a warm area and let it rise and double in size -approximately 1- 2 hours
		<p>In a large, sauce pan pour vegetable oil, until it is at least 3 inches (or about 5 centimeters) high (too little will result in flatter balls), and place on medium heat until oil is about 375 degrees.</p>
		<p>The dough is going to be slightly sticky so use your hands to grab a little bit of mixture at time and drop in the oil or use a spoon to spoon up the batter, and another spoon or spatula to drop it in the oil, sort of in the shape of a ball. Do not overcrowd the pan. Do so in batches.</p>
		<p>Fry for a few minutes (about 7 minutes or more until the bottom side is golden brown.</p>
		<p>Turn the ball over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is slightly golden brown.</p>
		<p>Use a large spoon or something like that to take it out of the oil. I usually place them on napkins right away to soak up some of the excess oil.</p>
